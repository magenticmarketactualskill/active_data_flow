# ActiveDataFlow

A modular stream processing framework for Ruby inspired by Apache Flink. Provides a plugin-based architecture where a core gem defines abstract interfaces and separate gems provide concrete implementations for different runtimes and connectors.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'active_data_flow'
```

And then execute:

```bash
bundle install
```

## Setup

Run the install generator:

```bash
rails generate active_data_flow:install
```

This will:
- Copy migrations to your application
- Mount the engine in your routes
- Display setup instructions

Run the migrations:

```bash
rails db:migrate
```

## Usage

The engine provides a web interface for managing data flows. Access it at:

```
http://localhost:3000/active_data_flow
```

### Mounting the Engine

The install generator automatically mounts the engine, but you can also mount it manually in `config/routes.rb`:

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  mount ActiveDataFlow::Engine => "/active_data_flow"
end
```

### Creating Data Flows

Data flows can be created programmatically by passing actual source, sink, and runtime instances:

```ruby
# Option 1: Using named scopes (serializable - recommended for persistence)
source = ActiveDataFlow::Connector::Source::ActiveRecordSource.new(
  model_class: User,
  scope_name: :active,  # Calls User.active
  batch_size: 100
)

# Option 2: Using a scope directly (for immediate use, not serializable)
source = ActiveDataFlow::Connector::Source::ActiveRecordSource.new(
  scope: User.where(active: true).order(:created_at),
  batch_size: 100
)

sink = ActiveDataFlow::Connector::Sink::ActiveRecordSink.new(
  model_class: UserBackup,
  batch_size: 100
)

runtime = ActiveDataFlow::Runtime::Heartbeat.new(
  interval: 60
)

# Create the data flow with instances
ActiveDataFlow::DataFlow.create!(
  name: "user_sync",
  source: source,
  sink: sink,
  runtime: runtime
)
```

**Note:** For data flows that need to be persisted and reloaded, use the `model_class` + `scope_name` approach. Direct scopes work for immediate execution but cannot be fully serialized.

## Architecture

ActiveDataFlow follows a plugin-based architecture:

- **Core gem** (`active_data_flow`): Provides Rails engine and abstract interfaces
- **Connector gems**: Implement data sources and sinks
  - `active_data_flow-connector-source-active_record`
  - `active_data_flow-connector-sink-active_record`
- **Runtime gems**: Implement execution environments
  - `active_data_flow-runtime-heartbeat`

## Development

After checking out the repo, run:

```bash
bundle install
```

To run tests:

```bash
bundle exec rspec
```
